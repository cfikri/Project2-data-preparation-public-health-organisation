The agency ***Santé publique France*** wishes to improve its ***Open Food Facts*** database and is seeking the services of your company. This open-source database is made available to individuals and organizations to help them understand the nutritional quality of products.

Currently, adding a product to the *Open Food Facts* database requires filling out numerous text and numerical fields, which can lead to input errors and missing values in the database.

*Santé publique France* has entrusted your company with creating a suggestion or auto-completion system to help users fill in the database more efficiently.

As a first step, **you are assigned to the project to clean and explore the data internally in order to assess the feasibility of this application idea from Santé publique France.**

**Skills involved**:

- Data cleaning

- Univariate and bivariate data analysis

- Exploratory data analysis
